          Welcome to Lumbini, the sacred birthplace of Buddha and one of the
          most revered pilgrimage sites in the world. Located in the Rupandehi
          District of Nepal, Lumbini holds immense significance for millions of
          Buddhists worldwide. According to tradition, it was here, in the 6th
          century BCE, that Queen Maya Devi gave birth to Prince Siddhartha
          Gautama under the shade of a Bodhi tree. As the founder of Buddhism
          and known as the "Enlightened One," Buddha's teachings have shaped the
          spiritual and philosophical landscape of humanity. Today, Lumbini
          stands as a tranquil and spiritually enriching destination,
          encompassing numerous monasteries, temples, and archaeological remains
          that offer visitors a glimpse into the life and legacy of one of
          history's most influential figures.
